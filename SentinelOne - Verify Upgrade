NOTE 1: This scope of this script is to upgrade existing installs of the SentinelOne agent and where SentienlOne agents are not yet installed, schedule the 'Deploy SentinelOne Agent' script.

NOTE 1.1: The scheduling of the 'Deploy SentinelOne Agent' script can be stopped, by DISABLING lines 1 - 6 of THIS scirpt.

NOTE 2: While the script provided will NOT reboot the endpoints (after successful agent upgrade) it is strongly advised for you to schedule this action, at your clientsâ€™ earliest convenience, to enable full SentinelOne visibility & control.

NOTE 3:  Please add your SentinelOne API key, as a value to the 'SentinelOne_API_Key' variable, on the 'Globals and Parameters' tab of this script. This key will be used as part of the upgrade process.

NOTE 4: This script will only update SentinelOne agent on Windows OS. MACOSX agent updating is not yet supported at this time. (Feb 2021).

======

The script will:
- Check to see if the SentinelOne agent is currently deployed on the endpoint:
  - If a SentinelOne agent is installed, it will attempt the upgrade it to the current 'GA' version.
  - If a SentinelOne agent is NOT installed, it will schedule the deployment of an agent. (See note 1.1 above).

- Validate that a SentinelOne Site Token has been set for the (Automate) Client. (This is done by checking the 'SentinelOne_Site_Token' client-level EDF).

- Download the current 'SOC approved' version of the SentinelOne Installer (at time of script run) & upgrade the existing SentinelOne agent on the endpoint.
