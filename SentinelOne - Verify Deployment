"NOTE 1: This scope of this script is to deploy the SentinelOne agent ONLY. Please use your SentinelOne Cloud Management Console to manage the agent once installed.

NOTE 2: While the script provided will NOT reboot the endpoints (after successful agent installation) it is strongly advised that you schedule this action, at your clientsâ€™ earliest convenience, to enable full SentinelOne visibility & control.

NOTE 3: For MACOSX installs; Due to existing security features in the MAC operating system, the SentinelOne agent must be granted 'Full Disk' permissions, after installation - and as of right now, this is a manual process. Please refer to SentinelOne documentation for further details.

======

The script will:
- Check to see if the SentinelOne agent is already deployed on the endpoint. If so, this script will then exit.

- Validate that a SentinelOne Site Token has been set for the (Automate) Client and use that as part of the installation command. (This is done by checking the 'SentinelOne_Site_Token' client-level EDF).

- Download the current 'SOC approved' version of the SentinelOne agent (at time of script run) & install it on the endpoint."
